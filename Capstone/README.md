# Capstone Project
## Predictive Modeling of Property Hazards Prior to Inspection

****

This repository contains code written as part of a Capstone Project for SlideRuleâ€™s [Data Science Intensive Course](https://www.mysliderule.com/workshops/data-science-intensive/). The data set used for this project was taken from a [Kaggle competition on predictive modeling of property hazards sponsored by Liberty Mutual Insurance](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction). A copies of the training and testing data sets are also provided in the *data* directory as CSV files.

The goal of the competition was to **forecast the hazard score from variables that are available before the inspection**. A total of 49 models were created and submitted to Kaggle for evaluation against the test data set, using a wide variety of machine learning approaches. Note that all these submissions were made after the competition ended. Code for each submission is located in the *submissions* directory. 

The best performing model created for this project achieved a normalized Gini coefficient of 0.375 on the test data set.

For additional information on the data set, the predictive modeling approach, the results, as well as recommendations based on the modeling performed, see the *doc* directory. The doc directory contains:
