    "### Examining racial discrimination in the US job market\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Discuss statistical significance.\n",

    "\n",
    "To perform a statistical analysis on whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes, we will use the difference between two proportions. The first proportion is the proportion of resumes with black-sounding names that received a call back, and the second proportion is for resumes with white-sounding names that received a call back. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis (H_0) is that there is no difference in the two proportions. The alternative hypothesis (H_A) is that there is difference in the proportion of resumes that received callbacks, based on race.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Conditions\n",
    "The normal model will be applied to this problem. Two conditions must be verified before applying this model to the difference of two proportions:\n",
    "1. Each proportion separately follows a normal model.\n",
    "2. The two samples are independant of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate these conditions, we must first calculate the **pooled proportion**. The pooled proportion is the best-estimate of the callback rate, if the null hypothesis is true."
